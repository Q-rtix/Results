## Contributing

**Did you find a bug?**

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub
  under [Issues](https://github.com/Q-rtix/Results/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the
  problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Q-rtix/Results/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear
  description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the
  expected behavior that is not occurring.

**Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

**Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- First suggest your change in the [Results ideas page](https://github.com/Q-rtix/Results/discussions/categories/ideas)
  for discussion.
- There are no fixed rules on what should and shouldn't be in this library, but some features are more valuable than
  others, and some require long-term maintenance that outweighs the value of the feature. So please get sign-off from
  the
  project leader (Carlos J. Ortiz) before putting in an excessive amount of work.

**Do you have questions about the source code?**

- Ask any question about how to use Results in
  the [Results discussion page](https://github.com/Q-rtix/Results/discussions/new?category=q-a).
