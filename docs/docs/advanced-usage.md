# Advanced Usage

While **Qrtix.Results** provides a straightforward way to handle operation results, it also offers advanced features and
techniques for more complex scenarios. This section explores advanced usage patterns and techniques that can help you
leverage the full capabilities of **Qrtix.Results** in your projects.

## Nested Results

In some cases, you may encounter scenarios where operations produce nested results, i.e., a result within another
result. **Qrtix.Results** provides utilities to flatten nested results and extract inner results, enabling you to work with
them more effectively.

## Error Transformation

Error transformation allows you to modify or transform error objects before propagating them to higher layers of your
application. With **Qrtix.Results**, you can define custom error transformation functions to preprocess or modify errors
based on specific criteria or requirements.

## Result Combination Strategies

When working with multiple results or result sequences, you may need to combine them using different strategies.
**Qrtix.Results** offers various result combination strategies such as logical AND, OR, and XOR operations, providing
flexibility in handling result combinations.

## Result Mapping and Conversion

Result mapping and conversion allow you to transform result objects into different types or representations to adapt
them to specific use cases or interfaces. **Qrtix.Results** provides mapping and conversion utilities to convert between
different result types and customize result representations as needed.

## Asynchronous Result Handling

Asynchronous operations are common in modern applications, especially in asynchronous and event-driven programming
models. **Qrtix.Results** offers support for asynchronous result handling, allowing you to work with asynchronous operations
seamlessly and handle asynchronous results effectively.

## Testing Strategies

Testing result-based code requires special consideration to ensure comprehensive test coverage and robust error
handling. **Qrtix.Results** provides testing utilities and strategies for unit testing result-based code, including
techniques for mocking results, error injection, and error propagation testing.

## Integration with Other Libraries

**Qrtix.Results** is designed to integrate seamlessly with other .NET libraries and frameworks, enabling you to incorporate
result-based patterns into your existing codebase or leverage **Qrtix.Results** alongside other tools and technologies.
Integration examples and best practices are provided to help you integrate **Qrtix.Results** into your projects effectively.

By mastering these advanced usage patterns and techniques, you can unlock the full potential of **Qrtix.Results** and build
robust, maintainable, and scalable applications that handle operation results effectively and elegantly.
