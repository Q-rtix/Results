# Core Concepts

**Qrtix.Results** is designed to provide a simple yet powerful way to handle operation results in your .NET projects. This
section covers the core concepts and key components of **Qrtix.Results** that you need to understand to effectively use the
library.

## Result Types

At the heart of **Qrtix.Results** are two main result types: `Result` and `Result<TValue>`. These types represent the
outcome of an operation and can either indicate success or failure.

- `Empty`: Represents an empty object that represents the absence of data in the result.

- `Result<TValue>`: A generic `Result` that includes a value of type `TValue` in case of a successful
  operation. This type allows you to work with the result value directly without needing to cast or unwrap it.

## Error Handling

Error handling is a fundamental aspect of **Qrtix.Results**. When an operation fails, **Qrtix.Results** provides mechanisms to
capture and manage errors. The `Error` class encapsulates error information and allows you to retrieve error messages
and details.

## Extension Methods

**Qrtix.Results** includes a set of extension methods that enhance the functionality of result objects. These extension
methods enable you to perform various operations such as mapping values, combining results, and handling errors more
efficiently.

## Fluent API

**Qrtix.Results** offers a fluent API for chaining operations and handling results in a more expressive and concise manner.
With the fluent API, you can perform multiple operations on result objects in a single chain, making your code more
readable and maintainable.

## Pattern Matching

Pattern matching is a powerful feature in **Qrtix.Results** that allows you to match result objects against specific
patterns and execute corresponding actions based on the outcome. Pattern matching simplifies error handling and
decision-making logic, leading to cleaner and more robust code.

## Customization and Extension

**Qrtix.Results** is designed to be extensible and customizable to suit your specific requirements. You can create custom
result types, error classes, and extension methods to tailor **Qrtix.Results** to your project's needs. Additionally, you
can integrate **Qrtix.Results** with other libraries and frameworks seamlessly.

Understanding these core concepts will provide you with a solid foundation for effectively using **Qrtix.Results** in your
.NET projects. As you delve deeper into the documentation and explore advanced topics, you'll discover more ways to
leverage the power and flexibility of **Qrtix.Results**.
